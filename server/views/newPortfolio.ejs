                <p>
                    I’m Rehaman, a Full-Stack Developer with a deep passion for crafting dynamic and user-friendly web
                    applications. With experience in both front-end and back-end technologies, I enjoy building
                    solutions that are
                    not only functional but also provide a seamless user experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the years, I’ve honed my skills in various programming languages, frameworks, and tools.
                    Whether it's
                    developing robust APIs, designing intuitive interfaces, or optimizing performance, I thrive on the
                    challenges
                    that come with turning ideas into reality.
